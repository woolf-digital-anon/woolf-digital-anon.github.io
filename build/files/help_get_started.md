# Get Started

This edition presents 43 parallel micro-drafts, and argues through its form that none of these drafts constitutes a 'completed' or reasonably final version of an essay titled either 'Anon' or 'The Reader'. I discuss the documents' complicated, even convoluted form at greater length in [About the Edition](https://www.digital-anon.com/#/about/project). But, given this, where might a reader begin? One approach might be to read chronologically through the documents as they are sequenced; another might be to take one of Woolf's titles for the project as a whole as a methodology, and read at random.

Another approach might be to read thematically. This page offers suggestions for narrative threads that a reader could follow, should they wish to trace the development of a trope or image from draft to draft. The page is by no means comprehensive (nor could it be), but provides some pathways through Woolf's thicket of draft material.

## Anon's Biography

These fragments show Woolf figuring out the contours of a literary history that begins with the birth of Anon from birds singing in ancient treetops and his paradoxical death and preservation with the arrival of the printing press in the fourteenth century.

## Malory and Arthuriana

Thomas Malory and the _Morte D'Arthur_ are important to Woolf's literary-historical project. Caxton printed the _Morte_ in 1485 – it was one of the first books printed in England – and Woolf figures both Malory's work and Caxton's preface to the book as revealing common belief in the fifteenth century.

## Spenser on the Threshold of English Poetry

These fragments show another beginning for English literature: Edmund Spenser pausing on the threshold of the hall at Penshurst, the seat of his patron Sir Philip Sidney. Woolf depicts this moment of pause as a decisive one, one which determines that writing, and not music or painting, will be the predominant form that art in Britain takes.

## Early Modern Materiality

These fragments depict Woolf's fascination with early modern material culture, which she figures as speaking eloquently to life at the time whereas personal writings – letters and diaries – remained laborious and unforthcoming.

## The Birth(s) of the Reader

Woolf's account of the English literary past begins with the death of Anon, but it ends with the birth of the reader and a modern mode of subjectivity capable of reading in silence, to oneself. In some fragments, the reader is born with the shuttering of the playhouses in 1642, and in others, this mode of subjectivity begins with the publication of Robert Burton's _The Anatomy of Melancholy_ in 1621. These fragments show Woolf's competing accounts of the birth of the reader.
