## [A Brief History of Anonymity](#a-brief-history-of-anonymity)

Virginia Woolf's thoughts turned to the past in the final years of her life and she began three historical projects, none of which she would live to see in print. The best-known of these is the novel _Between the Acts_, edited and published posthumously by Leonard Woolf in 1941. She also left drafts towards a memoir, titled 'A Sketch of the Past', unfinished at the time of her death. The third, and most fragmentary, of these projects was the history of English literature that she referred to variously as 'Reading at Random' or 'Turning the Page' but which is known today by the dual title of 'Anon' and 'The Reader': I discuss the various titles and of these drafts below.

Woolf put pen to paper on this project late in her life: the notebook [RN2. [Holograph reading notes] Notes for Reading at Random...](LINK) is dated September 18, 1940. Meanwhile the only two draft fragments to bear a date, the handwritten document [M45. Anon. Holograph fragment...](LINK) and its typescript variant [M53. Anon. Typescript fragment...](LINK), are both dated November 24, 1940. This said, she had been considering writing a literary history for far longer. In _Virginia Woolf's Essays: Sketching a Past_ (2000), Elena Gualtieri writes about Woolf's 'desire to give a voice to those parts of literary history that could not find a representation in conventional accounts' (Gualtieri 36). She traces Woolf's career-long attempts to write these unrepresented lives, and details Woolf's earlier discussions of Eccentrics, in a 1919 essay of that title, and the Obscure, in the three linked _Common Reader_ essays (1925) grouped under the heading 'The Lives of the Obscure'.

On January 13, 1932, Woolf wrote in her diary that she had conceived of a project that would 'go through English literature like a string through cheese' (_Diary_ 4 63), and picks up on this thread some six years later when she writes on 14 October, 1938, of her intention to ‘collect, even bind together my innumerable [_Times Literary Supplement_] notes: to consider them as material for some kind of critical book: quotations? comments? ranging all through English lit: as I’ve read it & noted it during the past 20 years’ (_Diary_ 5 180). Her metaphor changes over the years from one of chopping and slicing, like a cheesewire through a wheel of cheese, to one of gathering. It is fitting, then, that her next mention of the project comes in a diary entry from September 12 1940: while 'blackberrying', she 'conceived, or remoulded, an idea for a Common History book – to read from one end of lit. including biog[raphy]; & range at will, consecutively' (318). In an entry dated 23 November, Woolf's common history project gains the title that this edition uses as her thoughts 'turn, well up, to write the first chapter of the next book (nameless). Anon, it will be called' (340).

Woolf keeps working at this project almost until her death. On 01 February of that year, she writes to Ethel Smyth that she is 'reading the whole of English literature through. By the time I've reached Shakespeare the bombs will be falling. So I’ve arranged a very nice last scene: reading Shakespeare, having forgotten my gas mask, I shall fade far away, and quite forget...' (_Letters_ 6 475). She quickly comes to an impasse, though, writing again to Smyth on 01 March that she is 'at the moment trying, without the least success, to write an article or two for a new Common Reader. I am stuck in Elizabethan plays. I cant move back or forwards. I've read too much, but not enough' (475). A week later, she writes again about the project in her diary, but that is the last time it appears in her personal writings before her death on 28 March.

From her first reading notes in September 1940, Woolf wrote some 273 pages of draft material spread across 43 different draft fragments. These variously narrate the birth of English literary language in the oral ballad tradition, the persistence of that tradition in the Renaissance playhouse, and the abrupt end of anonymous creation in the first half of the seventeenth century. In some fragments, this mode of anonymous and collective creation comes to a halt with the shuttering of the playhouse in 1642; in others it comes with the 1621 publication of Robert Burton's _The Anatomy of Melancholy_. It's worth mentioning at this juncture that there is no single draft in which Woolf inscribes her narrative. Rather, it emerges as Woolf drafts and redrafts, and it emerges from the subtle differences between each drafts. This invites a kind of lateral reading between fragments. I provide some examples of fragments where readers can see narratives emerging in this way [below](LINK), and an example of reading laterally across drafts in Phillips (2024).

## [Who was Anon?](#who-was-anon)

Woolf's literary history is not premised upon the big names of the English literary canon. Chaucer and Malory, Spenser and Sidney, Shakespeare and Marlowe are all present, and Woolf discusses their works to some degree, but they are less important to the narrative than Anon, Woolf's figuration for the anonymous ballad tradition that prefigures and makes possible English literary language.
