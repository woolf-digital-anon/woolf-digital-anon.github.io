## [A Brief History of Anonymity](#a-brief-history-of-anonymity)

Virginia Woolf's thoughts turned to the past in the final years of her life and she began three historical projects, none of which she would live to see in print. The best-known of these is the novel _Between the Acts_, edited and published posthumously by Leonard Woolf in 1941. She also left drafts towards a memoir, titled 'A Sketch of the Past', unfinished at the time of her death. The third, and most fragmentary, of these projects was the history of English literature that she referred to variously as 'Reading at Random' or 'Turning the Page' but which is known today by the dual title of 'Anon' and 'The Reader': I discuss the various titles and of these drafts below.

Woolf put pen to paper on this project late in her life: the notebook [RN2. [Holograph reading notes] Notes for Reading at Random...](LINK) is dated September 18, 1940. Meanwhile the only two draft fragments to bear a date, the handwritten document [M45. Anon. Holograph fragment...](LINK) and its typescript variant [M53. Anon. Typescript fragment...](LINK), are both dated November 24, 1940. This said, she had been considering writing a literary history for far longer. In _Virginia Woolf's Essays: Sketching a Past_ (2000), Elena Gualtieri writes about Woolf's 'desire to give a voice to those parts of literary history that could not find a representation in conventional accounts' (Gualtieri 36). She traces Woolf's career-long attempts to write these unrepresented lives, and details Woolf's earlier discussions of Eccentrics, in a 1919 essay of that title, and the Obscure, in the three linked _Common Reader_ essays (1925) grouped under the heading 'The Lives of the Obscure'.

On January 13, 1932, Woolf wrote in her diary that she had conceived of a project that would 'go through English literature like a string through cheese' (_Diary_ 4 63), and picks up on this thread some six years later when she writes on 14 October, 1938, of her intention to ‘collect, even bind together my innumerable [_Times Literary Supplement_] notes: to consider them as material for some kind of critical book: quotations? comments? ranging all through English lit: as I’ve read it & noted it during the past 20 years’ (_Diary_ 5 180). Her metaphor changes over the years from one of chopping and slicing, like a cheesewire through a wheel of cheese, to one of gathering. It is fitting, then, that her next mention of the project comes in a diary entry from September 12 1940: while 'blackberrying', she 'conceived, or remoulded, an idea for a Common History book – to read from one end of lit. including biog[raphy]; & range at will, consecutively' (318). In an entry dated 23 November, Woolf's common history project gains the title that this edition uses as her thoughts 'turn, well up, to write the first chapter of the next book (nameless). Anon, it will be called' (340).

Woolf keeps working at this project almost until her death. On 1 February of that year, she writes to Ethel Smyth that she is 'reading the whole of English literature through. By the time I've reached Shakespeare the bombs will be falling. So I’ve arranged a very nice last scene: reading Shakespeare, having forgotten my gas mask, I shall fade far away, and quite forget...' (_Letters_ 6 475). She quickly comes to an impasse, though, writing again to Smyth on 01 March that she is 'at the moment trying, without the least success, to write an article or two for a new Common Reader. I am stuck in Elizabethan plays. I cant move back or forwards. I've read too much, but not enough' (475). A week later, she writes again about the project in her diary, but that is the last time it appears in her personal writings before her death on 28 March.

From her first reading notes in September 1940, Woolf wrote some 273 pages of draft material spread across 43 different draft fragments. These variously narrate the birth of English literary language in the oral ballad tradition, the persistence of that tradition in the Renaissance playhouse, and the abrupt end of anonymous creation in the first half of the seventeenth century. In some fragments, this mode of anonymous and collective creation comes to a halt with the shuttering of the playhouse in 1642; in others it comes with the 1621 publication of Robert Burton's _The Anatomy of Melancholy_. It's worth mentioning at this juncture that there is no single draft in which Woolf inscribes her narrative. Rather, it emerges as Woolf drafts and redrafts, and it emerges from the subtle differences between each drafts. This invites a kind of lateral reading between fragments. I provide some examples of fragments where readers can see narratives emerging in this way [below](LINK), and an example of reading laterally across drafts in Phillips (2024).

## [Who was Anon?](#who-was-anon)

Woolf's literary history is not premised upon the big names of the English literary canon. Chaucer and Malory, Spenser and Sidney, Shakespeare and Marlowe are all present, and Woolf discusses their works to some degree, but they are less important to the narrative than Anon, the anonymous ballad tradition that prefigures and makes possible English literary language given form. Anon is the unnamed poet-singer who travels from house to house, singing 'at the back door' ([M1-8, 2 of 10. Anon..., fol. 1r](LINK)). Anon is 'the common singer; the undifferentiated'. Though Woolf uses the masculine pronoun 'he' to refer to Anon, Anon is 'sometimes woman; sometimes man' ([M45. Anon... fol. 2r](LINK)). This is not to say that Anon is a male figure, however. In _A Room of One's Own_ (1929), the speaker tells her audience that she 'would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman' and that it 'was a woman [...] who made the ballads and the folksongs, crooning them to her children, beguiling her spinning with them, or the length of the winter's night' (_Room_ 38). We cannot know whether Woolf intentionally recalls the language from her 1929 essay in these late drafts, but the similarity is nonetheless notable. Anon, or their voice, is born from the treetops of primeval Britain. Woolf quotes historian George Macaulay Trevelyan's account of prehistoric Britain and its 'untamed forest' in which 'innumerable birds sang'. This song is heard by 'skin clad huntsmen in the [clearings]' who mimic the song in moments of rest. Over time, 'the clearing became larger; the birds [fewer]; and the human voice sang instead' ([M52. Anon..., fol. 1r](LINK)). However, Anon is dead, and Anon's songs are knowable only because of the circumstances of Anon's death.

### [Dead to Begin With](#dead-to-begin-with)

In the earliest drafts, Anon is killed at the precise moment that William Caxton introduces printing to Britain, and sets anonymous, oral ballads in type. At the top of the first page of M1-8, 2 of 10, the first draft in which Anon appears and the first to be titled 'Anon', Woolf writes 'Anon died round 1477. It was the printed book that killed him'. She then deletes this paragraph, scoring through it as though she is not yet sure of her own argument, but at the bottom of the same page she writes 'The Printing Press has come. It is the Printing Press that preserves the dumb world' ([M45. Anon... fol. 1r](LINK)). A few pages later, Woolf rephrases this, writing that the 'Printing Press, which was to [...] kill Anon, preserved him' ([M45. Anon... fol. 4r](LINK)). Although printing technology allows for anonymous ballads to be preserved past the moment that they are read and sung, and transmitted far and wide, it also fixes them in a singular, stable form. In later drafts, Woolf argues that Caxton 'made Anon some one apart from his song' and thereby 'brought in the author, ended the [nameless? anonymous?] song of the audience', 'attach[ing] the song to the author' ([M45. Anon... fol. 6r](LINK)).

This isn't Anon's only death, however. In later fragments, Woolf writes about anonymous Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, and the effect that the nameless audience might have had on playwrights and their plays. In M110, Woolf writes that the 'anoymous playwright has like the singer this nameless vitality, something drawn from the penny seats' ([M110 [The Reader: Spenser with his eye]..., fol. 4r](LINK)), while in a handwritten addition to M111, set 3 of 3, she writes that 'Anonymity thus lay over the Bankside, [...] the author was not attached to his play' ([M111, set 3 of 3 [The Reader: Anonymity was a great possession]..., fol. 4r](LINK)). In Woolf's version of the early modern playhouse, plays are a collective production that are shaped as much by their audiences as by their supposed authors in a continuous feedback loop – although, curiously, actors are not often seen in Woolf's consideration of the playhouse, and when they do appear, they are not depicted as acting. The audience cannot be heard now, but their imprint on play scripts remains: Woolf writes that the audience's 'silence is one of the deep gulfs that lies between us and the play' and that 'if we could measure the effect of the audience upon the play we should have a hold which is denied us by the play itself' ([M108 [The Reader: There is a jolt at the points]..., fol. 4r](LINK)). But even this mode of anonymity declines and perishes, either when the theatres are shuttered in 1642, or a few decades earlier with the maturation of English prose. Francis Bacon's essays lay the ground for this, but it is Robert Burton's _Anatomy of Melancholy_ that creates the modern reader, ending anonymity but leaving the reading subject in a 'world where nothing is concluded' ([M112, set 3 of 3 [The Reader: so long as the play was dominant]..., fol. 3r](LINK)).

### [Anonymity Revived?](#anonymity-revived)

Woolf's investigation of a literary past rooted in collaborative and collective forms of creation is not just a turn backwards. Rather, it forms part of what scholar Barbara Lounsberry has called Woolf's 'interrelated, yet multiform, foray against tyranny and war', a foray that Woolf undertook from the 1930s until her death (Lounsberry 3). As such, Woolf's thinking-through of anonymity and anonymous co-creation are linked with, for instance, the Society of Outsiders in _Three Guineas_, which 'must be anonymous and elastic before everything' if it is to be anti-patriarchal and antifascist (1938; _TG_ 183). It also links to the 'mental fight' of 'Thoughts on Peace in an Air Raid' (1940), and that essay's call to 'think peace into existence' (_Essays_ 6 242). Anonymity is a mode of creation, certainly, but it is also a mode of subjectivity, and this mode can provide a way out from the 'shadow of the letter "I"', the 'straight dark bar' whose shadow renders everything 'as shapeless as mist' (_Room_ 75).

How does Anon help to think peace into existence? Anon may be dead, but Woolf tries to articulate a framework within which anonymity can be recovered, and within which 'by shutting out a chimney or a bungalow', one can still 'see what Anon saw-- the bird haunted reed whispering fen, the down, and the green scar never healed along which he came when he made his journeys' ([M51. Anon..., fol. 1r](LINK)). Though much else changes from draft to draft, this past landscape made visible through an act of imaginative identification, remains remarkably constant. Moreover, the 'nameless vitality' of Anon is 'not yet dead in ourselves': modern readers 'can still become anonymous and forget some thing that we have learnt when we read the plays to which no one has troubled to set a name' ([M111, set 3 of 3..., fol. 1r](LINK)). Woolf's renegotiation of the literary past is not nostalgic, but rather, provides ways of reconceiving subjectivity in the present and for the future. Anon may have been dead, to begin with, but anonymity certainly is not.
