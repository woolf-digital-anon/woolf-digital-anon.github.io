## [Documenting Anon](#documenting-anon)

Virginia Woolf never finished the literary history whose drafts this edition presents. Had she done so, this edition would look very different – if it existed at all. This is not to say that she did not write extensively, however. Woolf wrote some 273 pages of draft material, though these drafts are stubbornly non-sequential: they mirror and repeat and echo one another, circling back time and again as Woolf drafts and redrafts, writes and rewrites, conceptualises and reconceptualises the primal scenes of English literary history. As such, there is no one single document that we can say best represents Woolf's intent as author (if such an analytic is even particularly useful), or a text we can read as a reasonably final draft. Instead, we are left with a rich panoply of variant draft fragments, each of which asks to be read as a distinct entity.

There are some 43 separate, identifiable drafts in this corpus of documents. These are interwoven with one another textually and thematically, and interlinked with other, contemporaneous works Woolf was writing at the time. The earliest writing that this edition presents is her notebook titled ["Reading at Random or Turning the Page / Notes."](LINK). This is a handmade notebook made from scrap paper (curiously, the ragged, cut edge is at the top of the book and not to the side), which Woolf dated 18 September 1940. Woolf writes the next drafts in another handmade notebook, the eighth and final of a series of notebooks she had kept for much of her working life, titled 'Articles, Essays, Fiction and Reviews'. As the title suggests, this notebook series is dedicated for the most part to drafts of shorter pieces of factual writing and to short stories. The ten drafts of her literary history in this notebook, some titled explicitly titled either 'Anon' or 'The Reader', jostle alongside one another and her other writings. These fragments are sequenced as M.1–8, 1 of 10, M.1–8, 2 of 10, and so on. Woolf saved paper by rotating her notebooks 180 degrees and writing on the verso side (the back) of her previous drafts, upside down — when a document description uses the phrase 'In back', it refers to a draft written on the verso in this manner. These drafts vividly depict Woolf trying to think through the beginnings of a literary history premised on an oral ballad tradition which is, by its very nature, unrecordable, and the demise of that tradition, first as Caxton brings print technology to Britain and then as modern reading practices emerge. In particular, documents such as [M.1–8, 2 of 10. Anon. Holograph...](LINK) and [M.1-8, 7 of 10 [The Reader: If you have read this brittle & imperfect sketch]. Holograph...](LINK) show Woolf thinking with her pen, and show that this was not an easy task.

Woolf's later drafts were written on loose leaf paper, some handwritten (holograph) and some typed (typescript). The handwritten, loose leaf drafts correspond to M.45–M.47. Only [M.45. Anon. Holograph fragment...](LINK) is explicitly titled 'Anon', and it is one of two drafts to be dated — both this and [M.53. Anon. Typescript fragment...](LINK) are dated 24 November 1940. Despite this, identifying where one handwritten draft ends and another begins is relatively straightforward: the sheets of M.45 are pierced through by the prongs of one of Woolf's Multigrip binders (see below), while the first and final sheets of [M.46 [Anon: He has emerged then sufficiently from the undifferentiated voices of birds...]. Holograph fragment...](LINK) both have visible traces of paperclip rust. Meanwhile [M.47 [Anon: For why a gods name. Holograph fragment...]](LINK) is the only fragment written on a cornflower blue paper stock. In these documents, Woolf writes the birth of Anon in the primeval forests of early Britain and another beginning as Spenser pauses on the threshold of Penshurst, the great house of his patron Sir Philip Sidney, struggling to think reflexively about his medium — in so doing, he brings about the beginnings of English poetic language.

Woolf then begins to type her drafts. M48–M53 tend to read as though they are typed-up second drafts of earlier handwritten manuscripts, but tend to spiral in different directions. These documents are easier to read – Woolf was not the best typist, as is evidenced by her manifold typos, marked in red in the transcriptions – but harder to date. The first editor of the drafts, Brenda Silver inferred the order in which they were typed from the slow fading of Woolf's typewriter ribbon (Silver 363-4; I discuss Silver's edition in more detail below). On this basis, and on the basis of other internal evidence, the curators at the Berg Collection divided Woolf's typescripts up into sequences of separate documents. I have followed this division and sequencing for the most part, save for the case of M.54. As catalogued, this is somewhat of a composite document, and somewhat of a jumble, but I have been able to break it down into eleven separate sub-fragments. My sub-division is based on stylistics and thematics, Woolf's own (albeit inconsistent) page numbering, and the fading of Woolf's typewriter ribbon.

## [What's in a Name?](#whats-in-a-name)

What do we talk about when we talk about 'Anon'? The scholarly community has come to know these drafts by the dual title of 'Anon' and 'The Reader'. The New York Public Library's Berg Collection, where the documents are housed, has sorted the drafts into 'Anon' fragments and 'Reader' fragments, and the 1979 Brenda Silver edition uses the same titles, presenting two separate essays with these titles. But Woolf did not often use these titles to refer to her literary-historical project. Woolf uses the title 'Anon' to refer to the first chapter of her literary history relatively often, but uses the title 'The Reader' less so – only three times, in early manuscript drafts ([M1–8, 5 of 10. The Reader...](LINK), [M1-8, 8 of 10. The Reader...](LINK), and [M1-8, 9 of 10. The Reader...](LINK)). Given that she uses the title so infrequently, and that the two sets of documents overlap so frequently, in both general narrative and specific wording, I am sceptical as to whether there is an identifiable textual entity called 'The Reader' at all.

What did Woolf call her literary history? She gave her project a number of different names over the years. At times, she refers to it as a Common History or a third volume of _The Common Reader_ (the first and second having been published in 1925 and 1932, respectively). But she also refers to the project as either 'Reading at Random' or 'Turning the Page'. She uses these two titles in her earliest reading notebooks for the project, and they appear on the three Lifeguard Multigrip folders that the loose leaf pages of draft material were stored in when they acceded to the Berg. We cannot know what Woolf might have called her literary history had she lived to finish it. Her titles often change from draft to published work – for example, "Melymbrosia" becomes _The Voyage Out_, "The Hours" becomes _Mrs Dalloway_ and "Pointz Hall" becomes _Between the Acts_. But most readers of Woolf know these essay drafts through the Silver edition, and to date they have quoted and cited essays with these titles. Calling this edition _The Digital 'Anon'_ becomes a way to acknowledge this long history of archival and editorial labour, scholarship, and citation.
