# About the Edition

## [What's in a Name?](#whats-in-a-name)

What do we talk about when we talk about 'Anon'? The scholarly community has come to know these drafts by the dual title of 'Anon' and 'The Reader'. The New York Public Library's Berg Collection, where the documents are housed, has sorted the drafts into 'Anon' fragments and 'Reader' fragments, and the 1979 Brenda Silver edition uses the same titles, presenting two separate essays with these titles. But Woolf did not often use these titles to refer to her literary-historical project. Woolf uses the title 'Anon' to refer to the first chapter of her literary history relatively often, but uses the title 'The Reader' less so – only three times, in early manuscript drafts ([M1–8, 5 of 10. The Reader...](LINK), [M1-8, 8 of 10. The Reader...](LINK), and [M1-8, 9 of 10. The Reader...](LINK)). Given that she uses the title so infrequently, and that the two sets of documents overlap so frequently, in both general narrative and specific wording, I am sceptical as to whether there is an identifiable textual entity called 'The Reader' at all.

What did Woolf call her literary history? She gave her project a number of different names over the years. At times, she refers to it as a Common History or a third volume of _The Common Reader_ (the first and second having been published in 1925 and 1932, respectively). But she also refers to the project as either 'Reading at Random' or 'Turning the Page'. She uses these two titles in her earliest reading notebooks for the project, and they appear on the three Lifeguard Multigrip folders that the loose leaf pages of draft material were stored in when they acceded to the Berg. We cannot know what Woolf might have called her literary history had she lived to finish it. Her titles often change from draft to published work – for example, "Melymbrosia" becomes _The Voyage Out_, "The Hours" becomes _Mrs Dalloway_ and "Pointz Hall" becomes _Between the Acts_. But most readers of Woolf know these essay drafts through the Silver edition, and to date they have quoted and cited essays with these titles. Calling this edition _The Digital 'Anon'_ becomes a way to acknowledge this long history of citation.
