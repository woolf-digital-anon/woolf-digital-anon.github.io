# Welcome to The Digital 'Anon'

___

_The Digital 'Anon'_ is a digital edition of Virginia Woolf's final, unfinished history of English literature.

In the final years of her life, Woolf's thoughts turned to the past and she began work on three historical projects. One was the novel, _Between the Acts_ (1941), another the unfinished memoir 'A Sketch of the Past' (1976, second ed. 1989). The most fragmentary, though, was the literary history she called, variously, 'Reading at Random' or 'Turning the Page', but which has become better known today by the dual title of 'Anon' and 'The Reader'.

Woolf wrote some 273 pages of material towards this project, scattered across 43 manuscript and typescript drafts which write and rewrite, work and rework the primal scenes of English literary language.

While some material from Woolf's literary history has been published, no edition has made this whole corpus available: _The Digital 'Anon'_ is the first resource to do so.
