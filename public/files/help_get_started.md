# [Get Started](#get-started)

This edition presents 43 parallel micro-drafts, and argues through its form that none of these drafts constitutes a 'completed' or reasonably final version of an essay titled either 'Anon' or 'The Reader'. I discuss the documents' complicated, even convoluted form at greater length in [About the Edition](LINK). But, given this, where might a reader begin? One approach might be to read chronologically through the documents as they are sequenced; another might be to take one of Woolf's titles for the project as a whole as a methodology, and read at random.

Another approach might be to read thematically. This page offers suggestions for narrative threads that a reader could follow, should they wish to trace the development of a trope or image from draft to draft. The page is by no means comprehensive (nor could it be), but provides some pathways through Woolf's thicket of draft material.
