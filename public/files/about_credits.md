_The Digital 'Anon'_ was made possible by a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship grant (ECF 602-2022), hosted at the University of Oxford's Faculty of English Language and Literature. I am grateful for the support of both institutions, as well as that of Jesus College, Oxford, at which I was a Junior Research Fellow for the duration of this grant. I am grateful to both college and faculty for providing a welcoming and intellectually stimulating environment, and to Dirk Van Hulle for his mentorship over the three years of my fellowship. My thanks also go to to the Center for Manuscript Genetics at the University of Antwerp for their support and expertise.

The material in _The Digital 'Anon'_ is held at the New York Public Library's Berg Collection, and I am grateful to curatorial staff at the NYPL and to the imaging and permissions teams for their generosity and support. This project would not have been possible without the support of the Estate of Virginia Woolf, administered by the Society of Authors â€” my thanks especially to Sarah Baxter for her help in securing permissions.

_The Digital 'Anon'_ is built using [Necturus Compact](https://github.com/eXtant-CMG/Necturus-Viewer-Compact), an open-source XML viewer developed by Nooshin Shahidzadeh Asadi (University of Antwerp). I am immeasurably grateful to Nooshin for her generosity with both time and expertise.
